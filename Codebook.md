#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
###David Allan, July 26 2015

##Project Description
The project takes as input data from an experiment in detecting activities using accelerometer and gyroscope data. It outputs a tidy dataset containing mean and standard deviation values.

##Experimental Design and Background
The experimental dataset was generated by:
Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.
Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova.
Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.

The experiment involved using accelerometer and gyroscope data from a Samsung smartphone to detect six types of activities: 
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

## Experimental Procedure
The raw sensor data was taken from the Smartphone sensors was randomnly partitioned into two sets. 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The data was then preprocessed using filtering and sampling techniques. The processed data was provided in "training" and "test" sets shown below:

Training
y_train.txt - activities detected (range of 6)
subject_train.txt - a number from 1 to 30 denoting the subject ID
X_train.txt - 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables

Test
y_test.txt - activities detected (range of 6)
subject_test.txt - a number from 1 to 30 denoting the subject ID
X_test.txt - 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables

The file activity_labels.txt contains the six activity names listed above. The file features.txt contains the names of the 561 variables found the tables X_train.txt and X_test.txt.

Note: the "inertial signals" datasets were not used in this analysis.

##Analysis Steps
1. The training and test datasets were merged to create one dataset. The detected activities and subject IDs were added. 
2. The mean and standard deviation measurements (66 measurements) were extracted. Note: measurements of "meanFreq" were not included.
3. The activity names provided in activity_labels.txt were used to identify the activities.
4. The 66 variable names were cleaned up to make them more readable.
5. From the data set in step 4, a second, independent tidy data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This dataset is contained in the file tidydata.txt.
More detail of the analysis steps can be found here:


##Output Format
The file tidydata.txt contains 180 mean or standard deviation values for each variable. The variables are described below.
